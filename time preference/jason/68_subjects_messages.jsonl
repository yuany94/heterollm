{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "In this study, you will make a series of 45 decisions about how to allocate money between two points in time: one time is 'earlier' and one is 'later.' Both the earlier and later times will vary across decisions. Once all 45 decisions have been made, we will randomly select one of the 45 decisions as the decision that counts. We will use the decision that counts to determine your actual earnings. Tokens will later be exchanged for money. The tokens you allocate to the later date will always be worth more money than the tokens you allocate to the earlier date. Note that since all decisions are equally likely to be chosen, you should make each decision as if it will be the decision that counts. When calculating your earnings from the decision that counts, we will add the two $5 thank you payments to your earnings.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "In this study, you will make a series of 45 decisions about how to allocate money between two points in time: one time is 'earlier' and one is 'later.' Both the earlier and later times will vary across decisions. Once all 45 decisions have been made, we will randomly select one of the 45 decisions as the decision that counts. We will use the decision that counts to determine your actual earnings. Tokens will later be exchanged for money. The tokens you allocate to the later date will always be worth more money than the tokens you allocate to the earlier date. Note that since all decisions are equally likely to be chosen, you should make each decision as if it will be the decision that counts. When calculating your earnings from the decision that counts, we will add the two $5 thank you payments to your earnings.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "In this study, you will make a series of 45 decisions about how to allocate money between two points in time: one time is 'earlier' and one is 'later.' Both the earlier and later times will vary across decisions. Once all 45 decisions have been made, we will randomly select one of the 45 decisions as the decision that counts. We will use the decision that counts to determine your actual earnings. Tokens will later be exchanged for money. The tokens you allocate to the later date will always be worth more money than the tokens you allocate to the earlier date. Note that since all decisions are equally likely to be chosen, you should make each decision as if it will be the decision that counts. When calculating your earnings from the decision that counts, we will add the two $5 thank you payments to your earnings.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "In this study, you will make a series of 45 decisions about how to allocate money between two points in time: one time is 'earlier' and one is 'later.' Both the earlier and later times will vary across decisions. Once all 45 decisions have been made, we will randomly select one of the 45 decisions as the decision that counts. We will use the decision that counts to determine your actual earnings. Tokens will later be exchanged for money. The tokens you allocate to the later date will always be worth more money than the tokens you allocate to the earlier date. Note that since all decisions are equally likely to be chosen, you should make each decision as if it will be the decision that counts. When calculating your earnings from the decision that counts, we will add the two $5 thank you payments to your earnings.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "In this study, you will make a series of 45 decisions about how to allocate money between two points in time: one time is 'earlier' and one is 'later.' Both the earlier and later times will vary across decisions. Once all 45 decisions have been made, we will randomly select one of the 45 decisions as the decision that counts. We will use the decision that counts to determine your actual earnings. Tokens will later be exchanged for money. The tokens you allocate to the later date will always be worth more money than the tokens you allocate to the earlier date. Note that since all decisions are equally likely to be chosen, you should make each decision as if it will be the decision that counts. When calculating your earnings from the decision that counts, we will add the two $5 thank you payments to your earnings.
