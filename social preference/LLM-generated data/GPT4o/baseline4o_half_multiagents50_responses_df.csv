}","If I choose A1, I am guaranteed to receive 450, and person B receives 0. This is a straightforward option for maximizing my own payoff without consideration for person B. However, if I choose A2, then person B's decision comes into play. Person B will be making a choice under the assumption that I chose A2. If person B chooses B1, both of us will receive 350, which is a fair outcome but not the maximum possible. If person B chooses B2, then I will receive 450 (same as choosing A1) and person B will receive 350. Given that person B is aware that by choosing B2 they can ensure that both of us get close to the maximum possible payoff (450 for me and 350 for them), they are likely to choose B2. Thus, I would still get the maximum benefit and person B would also receive a positive outcome.

}","In deciding between A1 and A2, I need to evaluate the outcomes and potential benefits for both myself and person B. If I choose A1, I will definitely receive 725 while person B receives 0, which is beneficial for me but not at all for person B. If I choose A2, then my payoff depends on the choice of person B, with possibilities either being: (i) I receive 400 and person B receives 375 if B chooses B1, or (ii) I receive 750 and person B receives 375 if B chooses B2. Considering person B is choosing in ignorance of my decision, they will likely evaluate the options B1 and B2. Given B would receive the same payoff of 375 in either scenario but may reason that choosing B2 allows for a potentially higher collective outcome (since 750 for me is better than 400), they might lean towards B2. Hence, A2 presents a scenario where I could receive a higher payoff (750) while still providing something for person B, which might encourage a more cooperative and fair approach. Thus, I am choosing A2 for the possibility of sharing a higher total payoff with person B.",A2

}","Given that Person A has already made their decision, I need to choose between B1 and B2. If Person A has chosen A1, they receive 800, and I receive 0 regardless of my decision, so my choice wouldn’t matter in that case. However, if Person A has chosen A2, my choice does matter. If I choose B1, I will receive 800 and Person A will receive 0. If I choose B2, both Person A and I will receive 400 each. Given that Person A chose A2, they are forgoing a guaranteed 800 from A1, likely expecting some payoff from my decision. Choosing B2 ensures a fair split where both of us get something, instead of me taking the entire payoff. This may also promote cooperation in future periods. Therefore, I choose B2 because it benefits both parties equally, assuming Person A has chosen A2 with the expectation of receiving something.",B2

}","When choosing between A1 and A2, I have to consider both my personal gain and the impact on person B. If I choose A1, I will receive 750 and person B will receive 0, which maximizes my own payoff but leaves person B with nothing. On the other hand, if I choose A2, I could still potentially receive the same 750 if person B chooses B2, but I also have the chance to create a more balanced outcome if person B chooses B1, where both of us receive 400. Person B knows that their choice only affects the outcome if I choose A2, and assuming person B is also rational and prefers a higher payoff for themselves, they might choose B2 to maximize their own gain, resulting in me receiving 750 and them receiving 400. Hence, choosing A2 provides an opportunity for both a fair outcome of 400 each and an equally high personal outcome of 750. This combination of fairness and potential personal gain makes A2 the favorable choice.",A2

My choice does not affect the outcome in this scenario, so I should assume person A has chosen A2 for my decision to matter. By choosing B1 when person A has chosen A2, person A will receive 75, and I will receive 125. By choosing B2 when person A has chosen A2, person A will receive 125, and I will still receive 125. The payoffs for me are the same regardless of my choice in the A2 scenario (125). However, choosing B2 gives a higher payoff to person A (125) compared to B1 (75). Since my payoff remains the same and choosing B2 results in a higher payoff for Person A, I will choose B2.",B2

 ""choice"": ""A2""}","As person A, I have two choices: A1 or A2. If I choose A1, I will receive 725 and person B will get 0. If I choose A2, then person B's decision will determine the final payoffs. Specifically, if person B chooses B1, I will receive 400 and person B will get 375. If person B chooses B2, I will receive 750 and person B will get 375. Since person B will not know whether I chose A2 or not while deciding between B1 and B2, they will assume I have chosen A2. Given this scenario, it would be in person B's best interest to always choose B2 because it ensures they get 375, which is higher than the 0 they would get if I chose A1. Thus, by choosing A2, I am maximizing my potential payoff to 750 assuming person B chooses rationally and picks B2. It's a risk, but considering rationality, it's reasonable to assume person B will act in their own interest and choose B2.",A2
